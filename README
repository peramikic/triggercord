What is Triggercord?
===================
A new project, in early development stage.

A port of pktriggercord[1] to Android.

A tethering application for Pentax K and Samsung GX series DSLRs.

It consists of the pktriggercord based camera interface, a wrapper to a high-level API, and a android program that takes care of user interface.

The high level API is also exposed in python, mostly for testing purposes.

Goals
-----
 * Clean, simple user interface
 * Support for as many android devices and Pentax K cameras as possible
 * Intent-based extensibility

Feature Roadmap
-----------------
### Core (pktriggercord)

Implemented:

	* ioctl based scsi interface
	* K-30 support

### High-level API

	* Setting jpeg resolution and quality
	* Setting jpeg image tone
	* Bracketing
	* Intervalometer & other tools

### UI

Planned:

	* Secondary, review screen
	* Custom spinners with auto option
	* Custom buttons with secondary (long-press) functionality
	* Image settings menu
	* Application settings menu
	* Satisfy the camera intent

Android compatibility
---------------------
Android >= 3.1 is required. The device needs to be able to work in USB host mode.

Camera support
--------------
pktriggercord, which forms the base for Triggercord's camera interface code, supports most Pentax K mount DSLRs, including Samsung rebadged models, in one form or another[2]. Notable exceptions are early entry-level cameras (K100D, K110D) and the ist series, which are only partially supported.

Triggercord will focus on support for K-5 and newer models.

Support for the latest models (K-30, K-5II, K-5IIs) is yet incomplete.

Known bugs
----------
pktriggercord:

 * Pentax K-r ISO can't be changed in M mode
 * K-30 support is buggy
 * Green button not functional
